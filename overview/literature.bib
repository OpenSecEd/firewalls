  abstract = {An ever increasing amount of governments, organisations, and
              comp     anies employ Internet censorship in order to filter
              the free flow of informat     ion.  These efforts are
              supported by an equally increasing number of companie     s
              focusing on the development of filtering equipment. Only
              what these entitie     s consider right can pass the
              filters. This practice constitutes a violation      of the
              Universal Declaration of Human Rights and hampers progress. 
              This thes     is contributes novel techniques to measure and
              to circumvent Internet censors     hip. In particular, we 1)
              analyse how the Great Firewall of China is blocking      the
              Tor network by using active probing techniques as well as
              side channel m     easurements, we 2) propose a concept to
              involve users in the process of censo     rship analysis, we
              3) discuss the aptitude of a globally-deployed network mea
              surement platform for censorship analysis, and we 4)
              propose a novel circumve     ntion protocol. We attach
              particular importance to practicality and usability     .
              Most of the techniques proposed in this thesis were
              implemented and some of      them are deployed and used
              on a daily basis.  We demonstrate that the measur
              ement techniques proposed in this thesis are practical
              and useful by applying      them in order to shed light
              on previously undocumented cases of Internet cen
              sorship. We employed our techniques in three countries
              and were able to expos     e previously unknown
              censorship techniques and cooperation between a corporat
              ion and a government for the sake of censorship. We also
              implemented a circum     vention protocol which was
              subsequently deployed and is used to evade the Gre     at
              Firewall of China. },
